Badly made in 30 minutes as a response to 2023/10/17 CS2 update, desubticks the 4 movement keys and the jump button.

Download this repo and put it in cfg, change what key you want to bind to in `de_subtick.cfg` along with the corresponding `...off1.cfg` and `...on0.cfg` if needed then do `exec de_subtick` in console.

Alternatively, use gliptal's alias for less console spam extra desubticked duck and walk with `exec de_subtick2`. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/17ah0sl/full_desubtick_config_new_runthrow_bind/)
